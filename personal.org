* ~bees~ [2/5]
** DONE IARC
  - [X] submitted
  - [X] accepted
** DONE web frontend
  - lookin pretty good
** INPROGRESS figure out better methods for positioning
  - hoping that iBeacon will work
  - iBeacon works! but now what do I do with these RSSI values
** TODO food snooze
** TODO remote shutdown
  - need to make sure supercollider exits
* blog [1/2]
** DONE IARC
  - I can't believe I had to IARC this
** TODO python packages redux
  - thinking FAQ style is best
    - why can't I run a module inside a package
      - what's the alternative
        - careful, because this does cross into /packaging/
      - what if I cd into the package
	- cwd does not affect imports
    - what goes in ~__init__.py~
    - what is ~__main__.py~ and what goes in it
      - nothing but import+call
    - what's a namespace package and why does it suck
    - what's a circular import and how can i avoid it
    - why do reordering imports or avoiding ~from .. import ..~ fix circular imports
    - what should ~PYTHONPATH~ be
      - (nothing. the only use of it ever was combinator; it's obsoleted by virtualenv)
      - when should I set ~PYTHONPATH~
      - ok, what about ~sys.path~
    - what's a toplevel module
    - what's an implicit relative import, and why is it bad
  - indicate the old guide is superseded
  - including examples of error messages is important
  - github repo of correct/incorrect examples?
    - linking "real" code doesn't help and can be confusing
    - probably best to use something slightly more real than spam/eggs/foo/bar
  - /packages/, not /packaging/
    - a packaging guide should be separate
    - ~src~ vs. not is stylistic and doesn't matter for any examples given
* ~rust-fnconcat~ [1/3]
** DONE IARC
** TODO write docs
** TODO evaluate if a quasiquoting thing or aster would be a better fit
* ~OCTCL~
** TODO modernization
*** TODO port to gradle
*** TODO complete 8.4 → 8.5 migration
**** TODO ~TclDict~
*** TODO complete 8.5 → 8.6 migration
  - what the heck even goes into this?
  - look into auto-parking i guess
** TODO make some OS
  - involves using ~[interp ...]~ for sandboxing the java stuff out, probably
