  - http://mirage.github.io/irmin/Irmin.html#basics
*** OBSOLETE ~serde_proto~
  - switching to capnproto instead.
*** TODO ~emscripten~ support [0/2]
**** TODO ~rust-emscripten~ / ~tokio-xhr~ [1/3]
  - [X] IARC
    - [X] submitted
    - [X] accepted
  - [ ] tests??? (how)
  - [ ] use ~tokio~ services
    - figure out how to interoperate with other http services
    - use the split-out ~hyper~?
    - https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-service
**** BLOCKED ~hyper~ [0/1]
  - [ ] split hyper into multiple crates
    - that is, if they approve
    - https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/894
*** TODO figure out if you can easily read/write to github from mobile
*** TODO get rust stable running on ~emscripten~
**** TODO ~rustup.rs~
  - [ ] submit PR for installing from local tarballs
    - [ ] tests
    - [ ] submit patch
*** maybe this would all be easier with cordova
** DONE ~ramp~ [1/1]
  - [X] use ~num_traits~
    - [X] https://github.com/Aatch/ramp/pull/75
    - [X] submit patch
** TODO fully port to rust
** TODO stabilize ~scrypt~
** TODO deprecate/remove yubikey
** TODO improve rolling settings forward-backward
  - you need to change passwords sometimes
  - add profiles per domain?
** TODO dedicated hardware
  - https://hacks.pmf.io/2015/06/24/the-beaglebone-black-as-a-smart-kvm/
  - probably will work nicely with the RPC
** TODO ~secbox~?
  - https://github.com/ticki/secbox/blob/master/src/lib.rs
** OBSOLETE factor out ~catch_panic~ vs. ~catch_unwind~ differences
  - there's less boilerplate required now
** OBSOLETE add a library context struct to the C ABI
  - can put the allocator function and last error into it
  - it's pretty nice to not have a C ABI
** DONE ~capnproto~ RPC
** DONE build/distribute a ~manylinux1~ wheel
  - can't decide if I should do this for the not-rust branch or wait for rust
  - rust means more build tooling, so using rust is p much going to require pex
    - it's sad that one can't rely on rust tooling present
    - okay this is mostly sorted out by using docker I think
  - yes bundle up the rust backend
*** DONE automate building all three wheels [4/4]
  - includes fixing up setup.py metadata and README
  - [X] ~passacre~
  - [X] ~passacre-nobackend~
  - [X] ~passacre-backend~
  - [X] build everything with one command
** BLOCKED distribute a ~pex~
  - pex doesn't quite have the required support yet
    - https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/201
    - https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/316
** TODO port to ~click~
  - or ditch python for rust entirely?
  - unlikely in the short term.
** TODO use more capabilities in the rust backend
  - http://capsicum-linux.org/ the general idea
  - https://github.com/servo/gaol the implementation to use, perhaps
** TODO automate checking capnp schema backward compatibility
  - apparently this doesn't exist
  - should be easy to make
  - this isn't actually necessary in the IPC case (yet) because the client and server are updated in lockstep
** TODO figure out how to do passacre schema updates
  - oops, I never planned how to update the schema
  - even if long-term the plan is capnp in irmin, somehow, that is a long way out
  - capnp in sqlite?
    - it's at least possible to turn capnp into json
** INPROGRESS figure out wordlist attribution/license
  - what a mess
* ~serde_proto~ [1/4]
** TODO figure out releasing
  - [ ] sort out requirements

  - http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/ignoring-errors.html#in-line-ignoring-errors
** DONE move off of ~lib2to3~, which sucks.
  - https://github.com/habnabit/ebb-lint/issues/4
** TODO sort out blanket vs. specific ~noqa~ in ~flake8~
  - https://github.com/habnabit/ebb-lint/issues/7
** BLOCKED wait on coverage to fix unicode (again)
  - https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/commits/7c05ee04feb3af5bc8d74ca73b65923bf25c04dc
* ~awpa~ [2/5]
** DONE IARC
  - [X] submitted

* box configuration [1/5]
** OBSOLETE ifstated for comcast DHCP
  - https://calomel.org/ifstated.html
  - might not be necessary with the new modem
  - it wasn't necessary; the new modem is stable
** TODO move everything to freebsd
** TODO stop hand-rolling my own CA
  - [ ] see if ~vault~ is actually usable for this
    - https://github.com/jhaals/ansible-vault maybe?
    - how can I back up a vault
  - [ ] move over openvpn
  - [ ] move over postfix

* ~bees~ [4/6]
** DONE IARC
  - [X] submitted
  - [X] accepted
** DONE web frontend
  - lookin pretty good
** INPROGRESS figure out better methods for positioning
  - hoping that iBeacon will work
  - iBeacon works! but now what do I do with these RSSI values
** DONE food snooze
** DONE remote shutdown
  - need to make sure supercollider exits
  - it exits, but not reliably
** TODO make supercollider exit more reliable
* blog [1/4]
** DONE IARC
  - I can't believe I had to IARC this
** TODO python packages redux
  - prior art: https://gist.github.com/datagrok/2199506
  - thinking FAQ style is best
    - why can't I run a module inside a package
      - what's the alternative
        - careful, because this does cross into /packaging/
      - what if I cd into the package
	- cwd does not affect imports
    - what goes in ~__init__.py~
    - what is ~__main__.py~ and what goes in it
      - nothing but import+call
    - what's a namespace package and why does it suck
    - what's a circular import and how can i avoid it
    - why do reordering imports or avoiding ~from .. import ..~ fix circular imports
    - what should ~PYTHONPATH~ be
      - (nothing. the only use of it ever was combinator; it's obsoleted by virtualenv)
      - when should I set ~PYTHONPATH~
      - ok, what about ~sys.path~
    - what's a toplevel module
    - what's an implicit relative import, and why is it bad
  - indicate the old guide is superseded
  - including examples of error messages is important
  - github repo of correct/incorrect examples?
    - linking "real" code doesn't help and can be confusing
    - probably best to use something slightly more real than spam/eggs/foo/bar
  - /packages/, not /packaging/
    - a packaging guide should be separate
    - ~src~ vs. not is stylistic and doesn't matter for any examples given
** TODO don't activate virtualenvs
  - man I repeat this a lot
  - it does nothing useful
    - the magic is in the binaries, not ~activate~
  - it obscures which binary you're running
    - ~pip2.7~: does that run in the virtualenv or not? impossible to know
  - having the virtualenv in the prompt doesn't tell you what's installed in it
  - virtualenvwrapper makes the whole mess worse
** TODO ~run_until_complete~ considered harmful
* ~rust-fnconcat~ [1/3]
** DONE IARC
** TODO write docs
** TODO evaluate if a quasiquoting thing or aster would be a better fit
* ~OCTCL~ [0/2]
** TODO ~tcljava~ fixes/modernization
*** DONE port to gradle
  - as done as is necessary for now. might need fixups, but seems stable.
*** INPROGRESS complete 8.4 → 8.5 migration
**** INPROGRESS ~TclDict~
*** INPROGRESS complete 8.5 → 8.6 migration
  - expose/use NRE functions
*** DONE handle extant unpacked tcl libraries
*** TODO unbundle unused libraries
*** TODO be crossplatform
** INPROGRESS make some OS
  - involves using ~[interp ...]~ for sandboxing the java stuff out, probably
  - maybe not; one ~Interp~ and many ~interp create~ is difficult to implement.
    - don't want them blocking each other.
    - also harder to eval in the right ~interp~ (?)
